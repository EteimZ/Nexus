# Nexus 

Nexus is an educational javascript framework. It was built within a code session between me and [chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/chat). It demonstrates a few important frontend concepts like:

- component regitration
- re-rendering after a state change
- props

The nexus was chatgpt idea, so if another framewor called nexus already exists. it is not my problem. A lot of the code was generated by chatgpt, I helped by instructing it and fixing a few bugs. Meaning, I didn't do sh\*t. Although you can tell I wrote this readme because it is sh\*tty.

## Usage

Use python server run the code within the root folder.


```python
python -m http.server
```

You will be greated by the classic counter example.
